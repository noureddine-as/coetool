# coetool
coetool is a cli or gui program to convert from .coe files (memory map for a ROM in an FPGA) to image files and the other way around, load an image and generate .coe file. Original author: http://jqm.io/files/coetool/

# What I did:
changed some places to fit my requirementsï¼šconvert an image to .coe file in RGB888, not the original RGB332.

# denpendencies: 
python3 + PyQt5 + PIL

# Added features
This version is based on `https://github.com/shushm/coetool`. It adds support for exporting Coe format files intended to BRAM initialization. The outputs have been tested with Vivado 2018.1.

This version also supports exporting the images as C arrays of uint8_t or uin64_t (8 Bytes packed) elements.

- 1: launch the tool (GUI mode)
    ```bash
